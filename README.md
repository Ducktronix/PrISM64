==== PROJECT ====

Welcome!  This is the PrISM64 GitHub repository by Ducktronix LLC.  PrISM is an Arduino Mega2560-based programmable hardware interface that is a fully hackable machine and easliy cusomtizable by using readily available hobby electronic products and your own ingenuity. The PrISM64 was inspired by the Sparkfun  Simon gamebuttons  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10547   and the recent interest in popular MIDI electronic music controllers such as the Akai APC40 http://www.akaipro.com/product/apc40    I figured we could assemble an Ardunio-based version of something similar to one of these controllers that would allow users to not only use it as a MIDI controller deveice, but re-program it to be used as other things such as a system comtroller, game machine, sampler, sequencer...whatever!
