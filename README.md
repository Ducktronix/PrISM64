==== THE PROJECT ====

Welcome!  This is the PrISM64 GitHub repository by Ducktronix LLC.  PrISM is an Arduino Mega2560-based programmable hardware interface that is a fully hackable machine and easliy cusomtizable by using readily available hobby electronic products and your own ingenuity. The PrISM64 was inspired by the Sparkfun  Simon gamebuttons  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10547   and the recent interest in popular MIDI electronic music controllers such as the Akai APC40 http://www.akaipro.com/product/apc40    I figured we could assemble an Ardunio-based version of something similar to one of these controllers that would allow users to not only use it as a MIDI controller deveice, but re-program it to be used as other things such as a system controller, music player, game machine, sampler, sequencer...whatever!  The initial design will include rotary encoders, analog sliders, 64 silicone buttons with RGB illumination, 16x2 LCD, arcade buttons, built-in speaker and microphone, General MIDI synth, .wav file playback, mSD card and ?? The system will also include MIDI, audio in/out, and an Arduino shield header stack.  

An Arduino Mega2560 is the required processor of the system and connects inside the case onto male pin headers, so you can remove the Mega2560 and use it elsewhere if you like.  This also reduces the cost, as it is actually cheaper to purchase an OTS Arduino Mega2560 than it is to build it into a custom circuit.  The PrISM64 reserves the pins used on an Arduino UNO and links them to female headers on the back (inside?) of the unit to allow you to connect your own jumper wires or an UNO compatible shield, like you would normally do.  

This system designe will allow users to create all sorts of cool gadgets using the PrISM64. How about a Wi-Fi Sprinkler controller that plays Daft Punk while an eight-column color equalizer bar goes spaztik?!?!
